## About

**Chad** _n._ chocolate-consuming, code-churning, curious creature

Also, I currently work at Chikka's Connectivity Team. Yay.

## Hardware

I never had the need to use laptops until 2008, when I entered college and figured
that I could use the time between my subjects to code. I'm currently on an Acer
Aspire V3 with 4GB RAM and an i5 for a processor. I have a 1 TB WD My Book Elite
for back-ups and archives. Yep, my EHD is not portable since I rarely bring it
on the road with me.

I have an Xperia Z for gaming, music, and all-around mobile computing. Its decent
camera and ruggedized features makes it ideal for when I need to take a quick
snapshot; it can go even when it's raining!

For more artistic efforts at photography, I have Sony's SLT A35 with the 1855 standard
kit lens and the 55200 zoom lens.

## Software

* Linux Ubuntu for everyday stuff (I love LTS releases)
* Windows 8 for occassional gaming or for software I can't Wine (typically has something to
  do with device drivers or photography)
* Vim for coding and general text editing
* Eclipse for when I need to use an IDE (typically, on large Java code bases or for Android
  projects)
* LaTeX for preparing documents
* Google Docs/Libre Office for when LaTeX isn't the man for the job
* Evernote for, well, general notes and clipping stuff from the Web

## Dream Set-up

I don't exactly have a dream set-up but for hardware I'm really impressed with, the 2013
Apple Mac Pro is definitely it. I'm not really set to buying one (cost and logistic factors
aside) but if I ever get some Apple hardware, I'd definitely hijack it with some Linux
distro immediately.

For my personal work, I'm pretty settled with laptops. I'll invest in desktops the moment
I encounter a problem for which I'd need all the computing resources my money can buy but
I feel that highly unlikely to happen. Also, I'll invest in a better monitor when I level
up with my photography (i.e., if and when I start getting _**serious**_ clients).
