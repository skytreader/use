## About

**Chad** _n._ chocolate-consuming, code-churning, curious creature

I currently hack all sorts of things for [Kalibrr](https://www.kalibrr.com).

## Hardware

I never had the need to use laptops until 2008, when I entered college and figured
that I could use the time between my subjects to code. I'm currently on an Lenovo
IdeaPad 300 with 16GB RAM and an i7 for a processor. I have a 1 TB WD My Book Elite
for back-ups and archives. Yep, my EHD is not portable since I rarely bring it
on the road with me.

For artistic efforts at photography, I have Sony's SLT A35 with a handful of
lenses:

- The kit SAL1855
- For zooms I have the SAL55200
- SAL1650 F/2.8
- SAL35 F/1.4

## Software

* Linux Ubuntu for everyday stuff (I love LTS releases)
* Windows 10 for occassional gaming or for software I can't Wine (typically has something to
  do with device drivers or photography)
* Vim for coding and general text editing
* Eclipse for when I need to use an IDE (typically, on large Java code bases or for Android
  projects)
* LaTeX for preparing documents
* Google Docs/Libre Office for when LaTeX isn't the man for the job
* Evernote for, well, general notes and clipping stuff from the Web

## Dream Set-up

I don't exactly have a dream set-up but for hardware I'm really impressed with, the 2013
Apple Mac Pro is definitely it. I'm not really set to buying one (cost and logistic factors
aside) but if I ever get some Apple hardware, I'd definitely hijack it with some Linux
distro immediately.

For my personal work, laptops can so far take the load but I am dreaming of a
desktop rig with a 4K screen or two. I love mechanical keyboards and I currently
do have one (a Razer Blackwidow Tournament Edition Tenkeyless) but I do not have
the space to include it in my set-up, either at work or at home. I'd love to use
it again.
